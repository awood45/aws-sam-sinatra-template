# Cookiecutter Ruby Sinatra for SAM based Serverless App

A cookiecutter template to create a Ruby Sinatra application using [Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model). Based off of the [Serverless Sinatra Sample app by Xiang Shen](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-sinatra-sample) and adapted to work as an initializable AWS SAM CLI project.

## Requirements

* [AWS SAM CLI](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli)

## Usage

Generate a boilerplate template in your current project directory using the following syntax:

* **Ruby 2.5**: `sam init --runtime ruby2.5 --location https://github.org/awood45/aws-sam-sinatra-template --name serverless-sinatra-app`

# Credits

* This project has been generated with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)
